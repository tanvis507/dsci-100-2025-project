    "In this project, we explore whether it is possible to predict whether a player will subscribe to a video game newsletter based on their in-game behavior and personal characteristics. The dataset comes from a UBC research group studying player actions on a Minecraft server.\n",

    "We focus on a classification problem: can we predict the `subscribe` status (True or False) using player attributes such as their experience level, total hours played, age, and gender?\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, we explored whether player characteristics such as age, total hours played, and experience level could be used to predict subscription to a game-related newsletter. After cleaning the data and performing a data analysis, we trained a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier and tuned it using cross-validation. The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 69.4% on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that player behaviour holds some predictive value. Players with more experience and greater total playtime appeared slightly more likely to subscribe, while age showed a less consistent pattern. This outcome mostly aligned with our expectations. We predicted that players who were more active or had more gaming experience would be more engaged and therefore more likely to subscribe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings could have practical implications. For example, game developers or researchers may use behavioral features to identify players who are more likely to respond to outreach efforts. This can support better decision-making in areas like marketing or resource planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations to consider. The model included only a few variables, and incorporating additional predictors from the session-level data might improve performance. Also, KNN is a relatively simple method and may not capture complex or nonlinear patterns. Additionally, some players might subscribe or choose not to for reasons that are not reflected in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, it would be helpful to explore more advanced models such as logistic regression or decision trees. Including more detailed behavioral data, such as timing or frequency of gameplay, could lead to more accurate predictions. Further questions could examine how player behavior changes over time or whether certain types of gameplay are stronger indicators of subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates how basic data science tools can uncover meaningful patterns and help build predictive models, even with limited features.\n",
